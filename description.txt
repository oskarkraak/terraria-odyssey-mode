Odyssey mode disables some powers from Journey mode that would ruin the fun of an actual playthrough, while preserving the Journey mode features that reduce the grind.
It locks the difficulty on Master mode.

It disables:
- godmode
- difficulty slider
- spawn rate slider
- toggle biome spread
- far placement range
- freeze time

It preserves:
- unlocking (researching) unlimited items
- time speed slider
- changing time of day
- changing weather

Attention!
- Don't use with non-Journey-mode characters, untested!
- The mod can't automatically set the difficulty in multiplayer. Instead, disable the mod, join the world, change difficulty to Master mode, then enable the mod and continue playing.
