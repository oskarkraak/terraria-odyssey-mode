Odyssey mode disables some powers from Journey mode that would ruin the fun of an actual playthrough, while preserving the Journey mode features that reduce the grind.
It locks the difficulty on Master mode.

It disables:
- godmode
- difficulty slider
- spawn rate slider
- toggle biome spread
- far placement range
- freeze time

It preserves:
- unlocking (researching) unlimited items
- time speed slider
- changing time of day
- changing weather

Don't use with non-Journey-mode characters, untested!
