Odyssey mode disables some powers from Journey that would ruin the fun of a playthrough, while preserving the Journey mode features that reduce the grind.
It locks the difficulty on Master mode.

It disables:
- godmode
- difficulty slider
- spawn rate slider
- toggle biome spread
- far placement range
- freeze time

It preserves:
- unlocking (researching) unlimited items
- time speed slider
- changing time of day
- changing weather

Attention!
- Don't use with non-Journey-mode characters, untested!
- The mod can't automatically set the difficulty in multiplayer. Instead, disable the mod, join the world, change difficulty to Master mode, then enable the mod and continue playing.
